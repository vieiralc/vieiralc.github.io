### Welcome to my portfolio

<p>Here are some of my personal projects. I've been a software developer since 2018 and I have already worked with React & Redux, Angular & Ngrx and Ethereum Blockchain (Solidity and Truffle). Besides that, I've helped different projects on my current company. Some of the tech stack they used were: Android (Java), Swift (iOS), Python, C# (.NET), Splunk, Grafana and Open Telemetry protocol</p>
